# Facebook CLI app

## Run

To start the app, run

```bash
python code/src/application.py
```

App usage instruction can be found when it is started.

## Test

There are test scripts in the main() function. If you want to test it, I suggest you log in as Thomas (tom). He has 2 friends John and Jane and is a member of the group AST Class. From his timeline, you can see posts from his friends and one from Richard in AST Class who is not yet added to his friend list.

If you join group ML Class and open the newsfeed afterwards, you can see a new post from Jane in this group appearing on the newsfeed.
