# Advanced Software Technology: Assignment \#2
### Author: <YOUR_NAME(S)>

### Deadline: 01.06.2020 - 08:00 CEST

In this assignment, we will use the `Graphviz` library to generate a graph that reflects the state of your system at a specific time. Your visualizer should be able to generate from the command line a “snapshot” of the objects in the system and how those objects connect to others.

You can use this to-do list to help you keep track of your progress when you are ready to start coding.

### TO-DO:
- [ ] Copy the previous assignment to this repo.
- [ ] Create the module `grapher`.
- [ ] Generate object diagram from the current objects in the system.
- [ ] Save the diagram as `diagram.png` on the root directory of this assignment.

### Submission TO-DO:
Before your final commit, please make sure you go through this list.
- [ ] Write your name(s) at the top of this document.
- [ ] Perform a last test of your program.
- [ ] Make sure all the models are in `models.pdf`
- [ ] Make sure all the code files are in ./code
- [ ] Make sure to save the diagram on the root directory of this assignment. 
- [ ] If necessary, add any additional detail to run your code.
- [ ] Update `requirements.txt`

Best of luck!
